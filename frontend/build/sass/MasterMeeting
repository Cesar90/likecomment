Group CEO => This was your big idea in the first place. You believe in Empire Motor’s management. They just need more time (and a lot of cash) to turn things around. Stringent cost cuts at Empire together with a nine-month delay in replacing products at Elite should solve the problem. You’re sure you can persuade the British government to come up with some cash too.

Group Finance Director (Gerald A.) => You knew all along this would be a disaster.
Another two years of these losses and the company
will be in danger of going bankrupt. The only
solution is divorce! The problem is that finding a
new partner for Empire won’t be easy. Still, you
have to get out of this disastrous relationship
whatever it takes. (You believe that niche markets
are the future, and that Elite should concentrate on
its strengths and forget about diversification).

Group Marketing Director => At first enthusiastic about the broadened product
range, the poor quality and performance of the
Empire models is beginning to have an impact on
your company’s market image. The new models
look like winners, but it might be too late to
reverse the damage. You’re now not really sure
that your company needs a full model range.

Group Engineering Director (Jeeson) => You’ve invested a lot of time and energy in renewing
Empire’s model range, and would hate to see it
scrapped now. You’re determined to produce a
top-quality product for Empire. On the other hand,
many of your engineers are complaining about the
lack of resources for their own projects at Elite.
They want to ditch Empire and go for their own
medium-range models (three-year development
time), based on Elite’s engineering excellence. It
would require big investment but in the long term
might make more sense.

Empire Managing Director (Luis) => Your reputation and job are under threat here. The
problem is the resistance of the trade unions to
radical change, but now there’s not much choice.
Deep cuts in the workforce and new German
working practices are needed. You’re sure the new
models will be a success, but why are those
German engineers so fussy about quality? You
would have had the new model in the showroom
by now, even if there were still a few minor defects.

Empire Trade Union Leader => You’re in a weak position, but must try to protect
the jobs of your members. The company is
pressing for salary cuts and redundancies to
improve productivity. Your members have already
accepted a two-year wage freeze. They won’t take
much more. The problem is lack of investment
and lack of communication between the two
management groups.

Lawyer of Elite Group (Jaime) => You were the one in charge of the takeover of Empire Motors, even though you warned the CEO about all the risks it implied.  Elite’s stoke prices are starting to fall, and there are rumours that it could
itself be the target of a takeover from one of the big Japanese companies. You need to convince the CEO of this risks if losses continue over the next few months and analyze the probabilities of partnership with other companies.

British Government Representative (shareholder of ELITE) (Christian) => The press has been rumoring the possibility of layoffs at Empire or even the company declaring itself in bankruptcy. It is all well known that as a policy of your government you have invested in private companies such as this one.There’s pressure because bankruptcy needs to be avoided, as well as layoffs but investing more money at this point is a risk.
